## Quick Questions
```md
What does JavaScript pre-IE 5 look like?

Is everything procedural? No classes, prototypes, OOP, composition?

What about DOM binding?
```
  
### Yes, we have prototype.
In JavaScript, we have a few classics like `Math.round()`; a good example of  
a `class` with a `static` method. `prototype` isn't that at all. `prototype`  
is one way to add **non-static** methods to a `class`. Pocket IE 4? Has it.  

### Classes? We have those too.
Modern webdevs use the JS keyword `class` to make an Object-Oriented-style  
class: a blueprint to make objects from with the same `properties` + `methods`.  
To make a new object from your class, write `new Car("blue", "leather", 1982)`.  
Can we do this in pIE from 2003? Absolutely.  
   
### What about HTML DOM? `.innerHTML` is older than you think.
We can build DOM binding off two features, `.innerHTML` + classes.  
Check, check.

We had a working REPL for testing IE DOM y such. It has been lost.

also for paint this will make the table grid better.
`div.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend","<style>.board tr a {height: 78px;}</style>")`
  
***
  
To start, let's look at some JS: 
```js
function inpt(id) {
    if(document.createElement) {
        var _ = document.createElement("input")
        _ = window[id]
    }
    else var _ = window[id]
    
    return _
}
```  
*from ./lib/blank.js*

Remember, there is no createElement  
in the document object. This will always run else.  
But this if (along w the double var trick) will  
tell your IDE that inpt() returns an `<input>` element.
  
Now we'll look at a smaller function: 
```js
function num(id) {
    return  +inpt(id).value
}
```
*from ./lib/blank.js*
  
Here, we use our `inpt()` function to get  
an input. Then, use the `+` operator to tell  
our IDE that this function returns a `number`.  
  
The last bit is really powerful. It is so  
helpful y thoughtful to be included in  
such an old shipping version of IE. Let's see:
```js
var feels = {
    r: 70,
    g: 100,
    b: 100,
    happy: function() {
        this.g = Math.min(this.g + 10, 255)
        if(this.g > 100) this.b = Math.max(this.b - 10, 0)
    },
    sad: function() {
        this.b = Math.min(this.b + 10, 255)
        if(this.b > 100) this.g = Math.max(this.g - 10, 0)
    }
}
```
*from ./link/happy.js*  
  
Objects can hold functions within them.  
They functions can even take parameters -  
though not shown here. These sub-functions  
or methods can use `this.` to access the  
properties on the object. You then can  
use the functions easily `feels.happy()`.
