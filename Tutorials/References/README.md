[IE 4 supports modifying innerHTML while keeping event handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML)

> Even today, when setting innerHTML, event  
> handlers are destroyed. Use insertAdjacentHTML  
> to safely modify innerHTML. This is supported  
> in IE 4. Important to note, **not every**  
> **element supports this or innerHTML sets** - 
> see article.
